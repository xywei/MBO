# MBOX

An implementation of the classic Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme.

Particularly it is adapted to solve problems on solid surfaces. There are two variants, one without volume conservation
constraints, analogous to Allen-Cahn equation; the other with volume conservation constraints, similar to Cahn-Hilliard
equation.

## Dependencies

- Deal.II (with interface for Trilinos)
- Trilinos (for algebraic multigrid solver)
